<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I started my Affiliate Marketing programm journey shortly after my West African Examination, it was a
   whole bunch of fun and excitment. I learnt many skills including Paid Ads, Branding, Building of sales funnel, 
   Graphics and Customer service skills which I upgraded with a course from Alison "Customer Service Relation".
   I did freelancing on this skills of mine late 2021-2023</p>

<p>And I found love in "coding", it has always been my dream to develop an appilication but I was scared cause of 
  the scary things I heard and what I see programmers do on the TV, sometimes I would ask myself if I can really do this 
  untill I fell inlove with it. I now eat and dine with codes and my fellow programmers. Secondly it's one of the money 
  making process I love and enjoy a lot. I started my Programming journey 2023.

  take care of so I focus really hard on what I do in other to make ends meet. Am hard working, talented and 
  ambitious individual. </p>
